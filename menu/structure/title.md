# Title

## Example

```yaml
# The inventory's title
Title:
  - 'Hello, %player_name%!'
  - 'Welcome on TrMenu!'
  - 'Animated Titles support!'

# The update time of inventory's title (in ticks), Default: -1
Title-Update: 40

## Note

* The `Title-Update: #` setting will only work with multiples titles.
* If you only use a single title, you can use the `set-title: <text>` action to modify it within the menu.
